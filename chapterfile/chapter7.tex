We proposed DUP-OT, a distribution-based framework for non-overlapping cross-domain recommendation. By modeling user preferences as GMMs and aligning domains via Optimal Transport, DUP-OT enables expressive preference representation and effective cross-domain transfer without relying on shared users or items during the training stage. Experiments on Amazon Review datasets show that DUP-OT improves target-domain rating prediction, outperforms single-domain models even without source data, and achieves superior performance over a representative non-overlapping CDR baseline.
