\section{Background}

Information overload has become a critical challenge for users on modern online
platforms, including e-commerce websites, streaming services, and social
media~\cite{Bawden_Robinson_2020_info_overload,Lv_Liu_2022_info_overload,Zhang_Cao_Liu_2023_info_overload}.
Recommender systems play a crucial role in alleviating this problem by providing
personalized guidance and selecting items with the highest predicted relevance
from a large pool of candidates~\cite{Resnick_Varian_1997_recommender,Burke_2002_hybrid_recommender,Burke_Felfernig_Göker_2011_recommender_overview}.
By analyzing historical user--item interactions, recommender systems enable
users to efficiently discover relevant content, products, or services, thereby
improving user satisfaction and engagement.

Beyond enhancing user experience, recommender systems also generate substantial
business value by increasing sales, customer retention, and overall platform
activity~\cite{Jannach_Jugovac_2019_business_value_recommender}.
As the scale, diversity, and dynamics of online content continue to grow, the
importance of effective and robust recommender systems is increasingly
recognized in both academia and industry.

Despite their success, recommender systems face several fundamental challenges
that limit their performance.
One major challenge is data sparsity, where users interact with only a small
fraction of available items, making it difficult to accurately infer user
preferences.
This issue is particularly severe in emerging platforms or newly established
services with limited historical data.
Another critical challenge is the cold-start problem, which arises when new
users or items enter the system and insufficient interaction history is
available to support reliable recommendations.
These challenges stem from the limited availability of user--item interaction
data and can significantly degrade recommendation quality.

To address these challenges, cross-domain recommendation has emerged as a
promising paradigm that leverages information from a related source domain to
improve recommendation performance in a target domain.
By transferring knowledge across domains, cross-domain recommendation can
alleviate data sparsity and cold-start issues, particularly in data-scarce
settings.
However, most existing cross-domain recommendation methods rely on the
assumption that users or items overlap between the source and target domains,
and such overlapping entities are used as bridges for knowledge transfer during
training.
In many real-world scenarios, this assumption does not hold, as domains may be
entirely disjoint due to privacy constraints, system isolation, or independent
platform design.

Moreover, traditional recommender systems typically represent user preferences
as point estimates in a latent space, such as embedding vectors.
Such representations are widely used and can be effective in many scenarios.
However, point embeddings may be often insufficient to capture the uncertainty,
heterogeneity, and multi-faceted nature of real user behavior, especially under
sparse data conditions.
This limitation further motivates the exploration of more expressive preference
representations for cross-domain recommendation.

Motivated by these challenges, this thesis proposes a novel cross-domain
recommendation framework that models user preferences as probabilistic distributions,
specifically, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), and integrates optimal transport techniques to enable knowledge transfer
under non-overlapping training settings.
By representing user preferences as probability distributions rather than point
estimates, the proposed approach captures both the diversity and uncertainty of
user interests.
Furthermore, optimal transport provides a principled mechanism for aligning
user preference representations across domains, facilitating effective
knowledge transfer without relying on overlapping users or items during the
training phase.

The proposed framework consists of two key components:
(1) modeling user preferences as Gaussian mixture distributions to capture the
complex structure of user behavior within each domain, and
(2) employing optimal transport to align these preference representations
between the source and target domains.
Together, these components enable robust cross-domain recommendation and improve
recommendation accuracy in the target domain under strictly non-overlapping
training settings.

\paragraph{Training-time non-overlap and inference-time overlap.}
It's important to clarify the assumptions regarding cross-domain user
information that, in this work, we explicitly distinguish between the availability of cross-domain
user information during training and inference.
Specifically, we assume a \emph{non-overlapping setting during training}, where
no explicit user or item correspondences between domains are available.
This assumption reflects realistic deployment constraints, as it is often
infeasible to obtain user-level cross-platform identity information for all
users in advance due to privacy regulations, system isolation, or the lack of
prior user consent.

At inference time, however, the situation can be different.
When users actively interact with a client application, platforms may request
explicit authorization from individual users to link their accounts across
domains.
If such authorization is granted, cross-domain user correspondence becomes
available for those users, enabling the system to leverage their historical
preferences from multiple domains.
In this case, the proposed framework can incorporate overlapping user
information at inference time to further enhance recommendation performance.

Importantly, the proposed DUP-OT framework does not rely on overlapping users or
items during training.
Cross-domain knowledge transfer is learned purely at the distribution level.
When overlapping user information becomes available at inference time, it is
used as an optional enhancement rather than a prerequisite, allowing the model
to seamlessly adapt to different real-world deployment scenarios.

\begin{itemize}
	\item We propose a novel cross-domain recommendation framework designed for
	      non-overlapping training settings, where no shared users or items are
	      available between domains.
	\item We model user preferences as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), enabling a
	      distribution-based representation that captures uncertainty and
	      multi-interest user preferences more effectively than conventional
	      point-embedding approaches.
	\item We integrate optimal transport techniques to align user preference
	      representations across domains, enabling principled and interpretable

	      outperforms both traditional single-domain recommenders and
	      representative cross-domain baselines.
	\item We perform ablation studies to analyze the effects of distribution-based
	      preference modeling and cross-domain knowledge transfer, providing
	      insights into the contributions of each component of the framework.
