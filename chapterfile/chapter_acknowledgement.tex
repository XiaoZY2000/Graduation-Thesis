The completion of this thesis would not have been possible without the support and guidance of many individuals. I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to all those who have contributed to this work.

First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Toyotaro Suzumura, for his continuous support, insightful guidance, and encouragement throughout my research journey. His expertise and constructive feedback have been invaluable in shaping the direction and quality of this thesis.

I am also grateful to Chen, Refaldi, and Igor for their enthusiasm for research, which has greatly inspired me during our weekly meetings. The discussions with them not only enhanced my understanding of the research topics but also broadened my academic horizons.

I would further like to thank the other members of Suzumura Lab for their helpful discussions and continuous support throughout my study. They not only provided technical assistance but also fostered a collaborative and stimulating research environment, making my study abroad experience both rewarding and memorable.

Finally, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my parents for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout my life. Their belief in me has been a constant source of motivation.
