  abstractnote = {Recommender systems are tools for interacting with large and complex information spaces. They provide a personalized view of such spaces, prioritizing items likely to be of interest to the user. The field, christened in 1995, has grown enormously in the variety of problems addressed and techniques employed, as well as in its practical applications. Recommender systems research has incorporated a wide variety of artificial intelligence techniques including machine learning, data mining, user modeling, case-based reasoning, and constraint satisfaction, among others. Personalized recommendations are an important part of many on-line e-commerce applications such as Amazon.com, Netflix, and Pandora. This wealth of practical application experience has provided inspiration to researchers to extend the reach of recommender systems into new and challenging areas. The purpose of the articles in this special issue is to take stock of the current landscape of recommender systems research and identify directions the field is now taking. This article provides an overview of the current state of the field and introduces the various articles in the special issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;},

  abstract  = {For almost as long as there has been recorded information, there has been a perception that humanity has been overloaded by it. Concerns about 'too much to read' have been expressed for many centuries, and made more urgent since the arrival of ubiquitous digital information in the late twentieth century. The historical perspective is a necessary corrective to the often, and wrongly, held view that it is associated solely with the modern digital information environment, and with social media in particular. However, as society fully experiences Floridi's Fourth Revolution, and moves into hyper-history (with society dependent on, and defined by, information and communication technologies) and the infosphere (a information environment distinguished by a seamless blend of online and offline information actvity), individuals and societies are dependent on, and formed by, information in an unprecedented way, information overload needs to be taken more seriously than ever. Overload has been claimed to be both the major issue of our time, and a complete non-issue. It has been cited as an important factor in, inter alia, science, medicine, education, politics, governance, business and marketing, planning for smart cities, access to news, personal data tracking, home life, use of social media, and online shopping, and has even influenced literature The information overload phenomenon has been known by many different names, including: information overabundance, infobesity, infoglut, data smog, information pollution, information fatigue, social media fatigue, social media overload, information anxiety, library anxiety, infostress, infoxication, reading overload, communication overload, cognitive overload, information violence, and information assault. There is no single generally accepted definition, but it can best be understood as that situation which arises when there is so much relevant and potentially useful information available that it becomes a hindrance rather than a help. Its essential nature has not changed with changing technology, though its causes and proposed solutions have changed much. The best ways of avoiding overload, individually and socially, appear to lie in a variety of coping strategies, such as filtering, withdrawing, queuing, and 'satisficing'. Better design of information systems, effective personal information management, and the promotion of digital and media literacies, also have a part to play. Overload may perhaps best be overcome by seeking a mindful balance in consuming information, and in finding understanding.}

  abstract       = {The increasingly serious problem of consumers returning goods on e-commerce platforms has brought high costs to the Internet economy, carbon pollution to the environment, and waste of social resources. E-commerce platforms can provide useful information to assist consumers to make rational decisions, but they are often filled with useless, repetitive, and even false excessive information, which will lead to information overload and impulsive decision-making of consumers. Most of the previous literature focuses on reverse logistics, return policy, and consumer behavior tendency, etc. From the perspective of consumers’ perception of information displayed on e-commerce platforms, there are few research endeavors on the formation mechanism of perceived information overload on consumers’ return intention. Taking perceived information overload as an independent variable and consumers’ perceived environmental effectiveness as a moderation variable, this study constructs a chain mediation model that affects consumers’ online return intention. Based on the analysis of the mediating effects of impulsive buying behavior and cognitive dissonance, this study explored the moderating mechanism of consumers’ perceived environmental effectiveness on the chain mediation model. The results show that perceived information overload has a positive influence on online return intention through impulsive buying behavior, and perceived information overload has a positive influence on online return intention through cognitive dissonance. Perceived information overload also positively affects cognitive dissonance through impulsive buying behavior and thus has a significant positive chain mediating effect on consumers’ online return intention. More importantly, this research shows that consumers’ perceived environmental effectiveness can significantly moderate the chain mediation path by reducing the positive effect of the cognitive dissonance on online return intention. On this basis, this study put forward the corresponding managerial implications from the perspectives of consumers and e-commerce platforms.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, the number of live streaming platforms and the number of viewers have exploded. For example, in China, there are already more than 100 live streaming platforms as well as more than 300 million consumers. In live commerce, streamers use ‘information overload’ to affect purchase decisions, by making it difficult for consumers to think systematically; however, the mechanism of impact in this way has not been confirmed. In order to clarify how information overload affects users’ purchasing decisions in live commerce, this study introduces information overload from the perspective of "Heuristic-systematic model" to develop a research model. And 400 respondents were randomly recruited through various SNS platforms in Guangdong Province, China from July 1 to July 20, 2022 using a random survey method, and finally 297 valid sample data were obtained. To verify the validity of the model and to illustrate the impact of information overload marketing on consumer purchase decisions in live commerce this study conducted an empirical analysis using Smart PLS 3.0. The findings show that perceived product quality and fit, and streamer influence and expertise, positively affect consumers’ purchase intentions. The information overload strategy can significantly reduce consumers’ perceptions of merchandise fit and enhance their perceptions of streamer influence and expertise. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for marketing strategies in live commerce, and enrich literature in the field of marketing.},

  abstract   = {Recommender Systems are nowadays successfully used by all major web sites—from e-commerce to social media—to filter content and make suggestions in a personalized way. Academic research largely focuses on the value of recommenders for consumers, e.g., in terms of reduced information overload. To what extent and in which ways recommender systems create business value is, however, much less clear, and the literature on the topic is scattered. In this research commentary, we review existing publications on field tests of recommender systems and report which business-related performance measures were used in such real-world deployments. We summarize common challenges of measuring the business value in practice and critically discuss the value of algorithmic improvements and offline experiments as commonly done in academic environments. Overall, our review indicates that various open questions remain both regarding the realistic quantification of the business effects of recommenders and the performance assessment of recommendation algorithms in&nbsp;academia.},
