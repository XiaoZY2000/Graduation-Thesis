  abstractnote = {Recommender systems are tools for interacting with large and complex information spaces. They provide a personalized view of such spaces, prioritizing items likely to be of interest to the user. The field, christened in 1995, has grown enormously in the variety of problems addressed and techniques employed, as well as in its practical applications. Recommender systems research has incorporated a wide variety of artificial intelligence techniques including machine learning, data mining, user modeling, case-based reasoning, and constraint satisfaction, among others. Personalized recommendations are an important part of many on-line e-commerce applications such as Amazon.com, Netflix, and Pandora. This wealth of practical application experience has provided inspiration to researchers to extend the reach of recommender systems into new and challenging areas. The purpose of the articles in this special issue is to take stock of the current landscape of recommender systems research and identify directions the field is now taking. This article provides an overview of the current state of the field and introduces the various articles in the special issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;},

  abstract  = {For almost as long as there has been recorded information, there has been a perception that humanity has been overloaded by it. Concerns about 'too much to read' have been expressed for many centuries, and made more urgent since the arrival of ubiquitous digital information in the late twentieth century. The historical perspective is a necessary corrective to the often, and wrongly, held view that it is associated solely with the modern digital information environment, and with social media in particular. However, as society fully experiences Floridi's Fourth Revolution, and moves into hyper-history (with society dependent on, and defined by, information and communication technologies) and the infosphere (a information environment distinguished by a seamless blend of online and offline information actvity), individuals and societies are dependent on, and formed by, information in an unprecedented way, information overload needs to be taken more seriously than ever. Overload has been claimed to be both the major issue of our time, and a complete non-issue. It has been cited as an important factor in, inter alia, science, medicine, education, politics, governance, business and marketing, planning for smart cities, access to news, personal data tracking, home life, use of social media, and online shopping, and has even influenced literature The information overload phenomenon has been known by many different names, including: information overabundance, infobesity, infoglut, data smog, information pollution, information fatigue, social media fatigue, social media overload, information anxiety, library anxiety, infostress, infoxication, reading overload, communication overload, cognitive overload, information violence, and information assault. There is no single generally accepted definition, but it can best be understood as that situation which arises when there is so much relevant and potentially useful information available that it becomes a hindrance rather than a help. Its essential nature has not changed with changing technology, though its causes and proposed solutions have changed much. The best ways of avoiding overload, individually and socially, appear to lie in a variety of coping strategies, such as filtering, withdrawing, queuing, and 'satisficing'. Better design of information systems, effective personal information management, and the promotion of digital and media literacies, also have a part to play. Overload may perhaps best be overcome by seeking a mindful balance in consuming information, and in finding understanding.}

  abstract       = {The increasingly serious problem of consumers returning goods on e-commerce platforms has brought high costs to the Internet economy, carbon pollution to the environment, and waste of social resources. E-commerce platforms can provide useful information to assist consumers to make rational decisions, but they are often filled with useless, repetitive, and even false excessive information, which will lead to information overload and impulsive decision-making of consumers. Most of the previous literature focuses on reverse logistics, return policy, and consumer behavior tendency, etc. From the perspective of consumers’ perception of information displayed on e-commerce platforms, there are few research endeavors on the formation mechanism of perceived information overload on consumers’ return intention. Taking perceived information overload as an independent variable and consumers’ perceived environmental effectiveness as a moderation variable, this study constructs a chain mediation model that affects consumers’ online return intention. Based on the analysis of the mediating effects of impulsive buying behavior and cognitive dissonance, this study explored the moderating mechanism of consumers’ perceived environmental effectiveness on the chain mediation model. The results show that perceived information overload has a positive influence on online return intention through impulsive buying behavior, and perceived information overload has a positive influence on online return intention through cognitive dissonance. Perceived information overload also positively affects cognitive dissonance through impulsive buying behavior and thus has a significant positive chain mediating effect on consumers’ online return intention. More importantly, this research shows that consumers’ perceived environmental effectiveness can significantly moderate the chain mediation path by reducing the positive effect of the cognitive dissonance on online return intention. On this basis, this study put forward the corresponding managerial implications from the perspectives of consumers and e-commerce platforms.},

  abstract  = {In recent years, the number of live streaming platforms and the number of viewers have exploded. For example, in China, there are already more than 100 live streaming platforms as well as more than 300 million consumers. In live commerce, streamers use ‘information overload’ to affect purchase decisions, by making it difficult for consumers to think systematically; however, the mechanism of impact in this way has not been confirmed. In order to clarify how information overload affects users’ purchasing decisions in live commerce, this study introduces information overload from the perspective of "Heuristic-systematic model" to develop a research model. And 400 respondents were randomly recruited through various SNS platforms in Guangdong Province, China from July 1 to July 20, 2022 using a random survey method, and finally 297 valid sample data were obtained. To verify the validity of the model and to illustrate the impact of information overload marketing on consumer purchase decisions in live commerce this study conducted an empirical analysis using Smart PLS 3.0. The findings show that perceived product quality and fit, and streamer influence and expertise, positively affect consumers’ purchase intentions. The information overload strategy can significantly reduce consumers’ perceptions of merchandise fit and enhance their perceptions of streamer influence and expertise. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for marketing strategies in live commerce, and enrich literature in the field of marketing.},

To what extent and in which ways recommender systems create business value is, however, much less clear, and the literature on the topic is scattered. In this research commentary, we review existing publications on field tests of recommender systems and report which business-related performance measures were used in such real-world deployments. We summarize common challenges of measuring the business value in practice and critically discuss the value of algorithmic improvements and offline experiments as commonly done in academic environments. Overall, our review indicates that various open questions remain both regarding the realistic quantification of the business effects of recommenders and the performance assessment of recommendation algorithms in&nbsp;academia.},

In this paper, we first introduce CF tasks and their main challenges, such as data sparsity, scalability, synonymy, gray sheep, shilling attacks, privacy protection, etc., and their possible solutions. We then present three main categories of CF techniques: memory-based, model-based, and hybrid CF algorithms (that combine CF with other recommendation techniques), with examples for representative algorithms of each category, and analysis of their predictive performance and their ability to address the challenges. From basic techniques to the state-of-the-art, we attempt to present a comprehensive survey for CF techniques, which can be served as a roadmap for research and practice in this area.},

GroupLens is a system for collaborative filtering of netnews, to help people find articles they will like in the huge stream of available articles.

The rating servers predict scores based on the heuristic that people who agreed in the past will probably agree again. Users can protect their privacy by entering ratings under pseudonyms, without reducing the effectiveness of the score prediction. The entire architecture is open: alternative software for news clients and Better Bit Bureaus can be developed  independently and can interoperate with the components we have developed.},

  abstract  = {Low-rank matrix approximation methods provide one of the simplest and most effective approaches to collaborative filtering. Such models are usually fitted to data by finding a MAP estimate of the model parameters, a procedure that can be performed efficiently even on very large datasets. However, unless the regularization parameters are tuned carefully, this approach is prone to overfitting because it finds a single point estimate of the parameters. In this paper we present a fully Bayesian treatment of the Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) model in which model capacity is controlled automatically by integrating over all model parameters and hyperparameters. We show that Bayesian PMF models can be efficiently trained using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods by applying them to the Netflix dataset, which consists of over 100 million movie ratings. The resulting models achieve significantly higher prediction accuracy than PMF models trained using MAP estimation.},

In this article, we describe a new family of model-based algorithms designed for this task. These algorithms rely on a statistical modelling technique that introduces latent class variables in a mixture model setting to discover user communities and prototypical interest profiles. We investigate several variations to deal with discrete and continuous response variables as well as with different objective functions. The main advantages of this technique over standard memory-based methods are higher accuracy, constant time prediction, and an explicit and compact model representation. The latter can also be used to mine for user communitites. The experimental evaluation shows that substantial improvements in accucracy over existing methods and published results can be obtained.},

  abstract  = {Modeling users' dynamic preferences from their historical behaviors is challenging and crucial for recommendation systems. Previous methods employ sequential neural networks to encode users' historical interactions from left to right into hidden representations for making recommendations. Despite their effectiveness, we argue that such left-to-right unidirectional models are sub-optimal due to the limitations including: begin enumerate* [label=seriesitshapealph*upshape)] item unidirectional architectures restrict the power of hidden representation in users' behavior sequences; item they often assume a rigidly ordered sequence which is not always practical. end enumerate* To address these limitations, we proposed a sequential recommendation model called BERT4Rec, which employs the deep bidirectional self-attention to model user behavior sequences. To avoid the information leakage and efficiently train the bidirectional model, we adopt the Cloze objective to sequential recommendation, predicting the random masked items in the sequence by jointly conditioning on their left and right context. In this way, we learn a bidirectional representation model to make recommendations by allowing each item in user historical behaviors to fuse information from both left and right sides. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models consistently.},

  abstract  = {Learning vector representations (aka. embeddings) of users and items lies at the core of modern recommender systems. Ranging from early matrix factorization to recently emerged deep learning based methods, existing efforts typically obtain a user's (or an item's) embedding by mapping from pre-existing features that describe the user (or the item), such as ID and attributes. We argue that an inherent drawback of such methods is that, the collaborative signal, which is latent in user-item interactions, is not encoded in the embedding process. As such, the resultant embeddings may not be sufficient to capture the collaborative filtering effect.In this work, we propose to integrate the user-item interactions - more specifically the bipartite graph structure - into the embedding process. We develop a new recommendation framework Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF), which exploits the user-item graph structure by propagating embeddings on it. This leads to the expressive modeling of high-order connectivity in user-item graph, effectively injecting the collaborative signal into the embedding process in an explicit manner. We conduct extensive experiments on three public benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements over several state-of-the-art models like HOP-Rec [39] and Collaborative Memory Network [5]. Further analysis verifies the importance of embedding propagation for learning better user and item representations, justifying the rationality and effectiveness of NGCF.

  abstract  = {Graph Convolution Network (GCN) has become new state-of-the-art for collaborative filtering. Nevertheless, the reasons of its effectiveness for recommendation are not well understood. Existing work that adapts GCN to recommendation lacks thorough ablation analyses on GCN, which is originally designed for graph classification tasks and equipped with many neural network operations. However, we empirically find that the two most common designs in GCNs -- feature transformation and nonlinear activation -- contribute little to the performance of collaborative filtering. Even worse, including them adds to the difficulty of training and degrades recommendation performance.In this work, we aim to simplify the design of GCN to make it more concise and appropriate for recommendation. We propose a new model named LightGCN, including only the most essential component in GCN -- neighborhood aggregation -- for collaborative filtering. Specifically, LightGCN learns user and item embeddings by linearly propagating them on the user-item interaction graph, and uses the weighted sum of the embeddings learned at all layers as the final embedding. Such simple, linear, and neat model is much easier to implement and train, exhibiting substantial improvements (about 16.0\% relative improvement on average) over Neural Graph Collaborative Filtering (NGCF) -- a state-of-the-art GCN-based recommender model -- under exactly the same experimental setting. Further analyses are provided towards the rationality of the simple LightGCN from both analytical and empirical perspectives.},

Previous methods model a session as a sequence and estimate user representations besides item representations to make recommendations. Though achieved promising results, they are insufficient to obtain accurate user vectors in sessions and neglect complex transitions of items. To obtain accurate item embedding and take complex transitions of items into account, we propose a novel method, i.e. &lt;em&gt;Session-based Recommendation with Graph Neural Networks&lt;/em&gt;, SR-GNN for brevity. In the proposed method, session sequences are modeled as graphstructured data. Based on the session graph, GNN can capture complex transitions of items, which are difficult to be revealed by previous conventional sequential methods. Each session is then represented as the composition of the global preference and the current interest of that session using an attention network. Extensive experiments conducted on two real datasets show that SR-GNN evidently outperforms the state-of-the-art session-based recommendation methods consistently.&lt;/p&gt;},

This non-linear probabilistic model enables us to go beyond the limited modeling capacity of linear factor models which still largely dominate collaborative filtering research.We introduce a generative model with multinomial likelihood and use Bayesian inference for parameter estimation. Despite widespread use in language modeling and economics, the multinomial likelihood receives less attention in the recommender systems literature. We introduce a different regularization parameter for the learning objective, which proves to be crucial for achieving competitive performance. Remarkably, there is an efficient way to tune the parameter using annealing. The resulting model and learning algorithm has information-theoretic connections to maximum entropy discrimination and the information bottleneck principle. Empirically, we show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines, including two recently-proposed neural network approaches, on several real-world datasets. We also provide extended experiments comparing the multinomial likelihood with other commonly used likelihood functions in the latent factor collaborative filtering literature and show favorable results. Finally, we identify the pros and cons of employing a principled Bayesian inference approach and characterize settings where it provides the most significant improvements.},

  abstract  = {This paper provides a unified account of two schools of thinking in information retrieval modelling: the generative retrieval focusing on predicting relevant documents given a query, and the discriminative retrieval focusing on predicting relevancy given a query-document pair. We propose a game theoretical minimax game to iteratively optimise both models. On one hand, the discriminative model, aiming to mine signals from labelled and unlabelled data, provides guidance to train the generative model towards fitting the underlying relevance distribution over documents given the query. On the other hand, the generative model, acting as an attacker to the current discriminative model, generates difficult examples for the discriminative model in an adversarial way by minimising its discrimination objective. With the competition between these two models, we show that the unified framework takes advantage of both schools of thinking: (i) the generative model learns to fit the relevance distribution over documents via the signals from the discriminative model, and (ii) the discriminative model is able to exploit the unlabelled data selected by the generative model to achieve a better estimation for document ranking. Our experimental results have demonstrated significant performance gains as much as 23.96\% on Precision@5 and 15.50\% on MAP over strong baselines in a variety of applications including web search, item recommendation, and question answering.},

In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based collaborative filtering (CF) framework to provide higher accuracy in recommendation. We first identify a fundamental problem of existing GAN-based methods in CF and highlight it quantitatively via a series of experiments. Next, we suggest a new direction of vector-wise adversarial training to solve the problem and propose our GAN-based CF framework, called CFGAN, based on the direction. We identify a unique challenge that arises when vector-wise adversarial training is employed in CF. We then propose three CF methods realized on top of our CFGAN that are able to address the challenge. Finally, via extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we validate that vector-wise adversarial training employed in CFGAN is really effective to solve the problem of existing GAN-based CF methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our proposed CF methods on CFGAN provide recommendation accuracy consistently and universally higher than those of the state-of-the-art recommenders.},

  abstract  = {Generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are widely utilized to model the generative process of user interactions. However, they suffer from intrinsic limitations such as the instability of GANs and the restricted representation ability of VAEs. Such limitations hinder the accurate modeling of the complex user interaction generation procedure, such as noisy interactions caused by various interference factors. In light of the impressive advantages of Diffusion Models (DMs) over traditional generative models in image synthesis, we propose a novel Diffusion Recommender Model (named DiffRec) to learn the generative process in a denoising manner. To retain personalized information in user interactions, DiffRec reduces the added noises and avoids corrupting users' interactions into pure noises like in image synthesis. In addition, we extend traditional DMs to tackle the unique challenges in recommendation: high resource costs for large-scale item prediction and temporal shifts of user preference. To this end, we propose two extensions of DiffRec: L-DiffRec clusters items for dimension compression and conducts the diffusion processes in the latent space; and T-DiffRec reweights user interactions based on the interaction timestamps to encode temporal information. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets under multiple settings (e.g., clean training, noisy training, and temporal training). The empirical results validate the superiority of DiffRec with two extensions over competitive baselines.},
